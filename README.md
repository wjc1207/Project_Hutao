# Project_Hutao

Project_Hutao is a IoT project. Its main part is a desktop ornament made from arduino nano with a light sensor, a DHT22 sensor, a voice recognetion v3 module, an OLED screen, a RGB light, a rocker and most important, a hutao shake toy. The technique includes the arduino, FPGA, 3D printing, SoildWorks, Winform, web and so on.
